I am a PhD Student at the University of Amsterdam, in which I investigate automatic subtitling from a multitude of angles, such as their fairness and trustworthiness on the one hand as well as automatic speech recognition, the subtitling format itself, and automatic translation on the other. I am passionate about research that brings us closer to equal opportunities for all and furthers our understanding of AI as well as human cognition. Additionally, I enjoy presenting and finding the way to explain new material or answer student questions. Outside of work, I enjoy watching and taking photos of birds, practicing figure skating, speedcubing, and taking some downtime in reading and crocheting.
